# Snake Game

## Overview

**Project Title**: Snake Game

**Project Description**:  
This project is a recreation of the classic Snake Game using Python's `turtle` module. 
The game involves controlling a snake to collect food items while avoiding collisions with walls and the snake's own tail. 
The game keeps track of the player's current score and high score, which is stored and retrieved from a file.

**Project Goals**:  
- Create an interactive and visually appealing Snake Game.  
- Track and display the player's current score and high score.  
- Implement smooth gameplay with responsive controls.  
- Provide a reset mechanism for collisions with walls or the snake's tail.

3. Run the `main.py` file to start the game.

### Instructions for Using the Software

1. Use the arrow keys (`Up`, `Down`, `Left`, `Right`) to control the snake's movement.
2. Collect the blue food items to increase your score.
3. Avoid collisions with walls or the snake's tail to keep the game running.
4. Exit the game by clicking on the game window.
